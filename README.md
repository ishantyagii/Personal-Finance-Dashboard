# Personal-Finance-Dashboard

In this project we created a data visualization dashboard using Power BI that tracks metrics like income(salary,other scources), expenses(EMI,house rent,leisure,groceries,health), savings (emergency fund,fixed deposit,liquid cash,mutual
funds) monthly basis over course of 3 years. The dashboard also shows if percent of spending or saving is more according to income.
